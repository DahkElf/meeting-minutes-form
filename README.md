# meeting-minutes-form
Mobile web app for collecting SPSANA meeting minutes

Purpose is to assist the Secretary of the SPSANA PR Committee in collecting meeting minutes. The end results should be a webpage that works on both mobile and desktop. It should allow some means for "submiting" the form content. Due to lack of database this submit action will likely take the form of email and/or text download.

Mobile first webpage/webapp. Uses bootstap w/ minor customizaitons for styling and jquery for dynamic page content.
